First I entered the emacs repository for CS 35L:

cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L

1. Using the following commands:
man du
du -a | sort -n -r | head -n 2
find . -type f -exec du -a {} + | sort -n -r | head -n 10

Output of 2nd command (after man du):
520828  .
358316  ./.git

The second command (after man du) gives that the entire directory is 520828 bytes and that the
./.git directory is 358316 bytes. Thus, the working files take up 520828 - 358316 = 162512 bytes,
and the Git repository takes up 358316 bytes.

The third command gives the following output:

318152  ./.git/objects/pack/pack-24e56b1749b9320c560213d9045fa6cee42b4174.pack
23876   ./.git/objects/pack/pack-24e56b1749b9320c560213d9045fa6cee42b4174.idx
7888    ./.git/objects/info/commit-graph
6836    ./.git/gitk.cache
6736    ./test/manual/BidiCharacterTest.txt
4400    ./leim/SKK-DIC/SKK-JISYO.L
2508    ./admin/unidata/NormalizationTest.txt
2280    ./ChangeLog.3
1760    ./admin/unidata/UnicodeData.txt
1696    ./admin/charsets/mapfiles/cns2ucsdkw.txt

The pack files are large because they contain past versions of the emacs project, and because
the emacs project has been going on for a long time (this repository's history dates back to the
1990s), there are lots of old files. Also, there are most likely large binary blob files that take
up a lot of space, and these files cannot be efficiently compressed.

2. I used the following commands:
git branch | wc -l
git branch -r | wc -l
The first command gave the number of local branches to be 176, and the second command gave the
number of remote branches to be 177.

3. Using the following command:
git remote -v

This displays one remote repository, called origin, located at
https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git. It is used for both fetching and pushing.

4. I used the following command:
git branch --sort=-committerdate | head -n 10

This gave the following output:
master
scratch/joaot/make-completion-at-point-function
feature/windows-with-utils
scratch/completion-api
scratch/a-modest-completion-redesign-proposal
scratch/fido-mode
feature/gnus-select2
feature/extend_face_id
scratch/jit-lock-antiblink-cleaned-up
emacs-26

Each branch should also be prepended with refs/heads/ for the full branch name.

5. Using the following command gives that there are 139583 commits on the master branch:
git rev-list --count master

6. Using the following command gives the total number of commits across all branches to be 143910:
git rev-list --all --count

Dividing the answer to #5 by this number gives 139583/143910, or approximately 96.99%.

7. Using the following command gives the desired result, where the number in the first column is
the number of commits and the entry in the second column is the author.

git shortlog -sn master --since=2013.01.01 | head -n 10

8. Using gitk, I looked up the commits listed in the assignnment spec to create the following
commit graph. Some branches and/or commits not shown for clarity.
(Note: The graph is made up of 10 lines of text, each line having up to 150 characters)

          977cd ->   ...      ...       -> 0c06b93 -> ... -> ... _     ...                   ...           ...           -> abcb2e6 -> ... -> 98ac36e

	 V                          /                                              V                                    /                 /

                                                                                            \                         /                 /

Basically, what is happening is that after a change to "Cope better with C++..." (commit 4ea37c),
this change is merged into the master branch and emacs is incremented to version
27.0.50 (commit 977cd), and then an emacs 26 release branch is started (commit 625cee). On this
branch, changes are made such as adding a lisp variable (5490ccc), and then this change is
eventually merged into the master branch. Then, a new branch is created where eventually, a change
is made to doc/emacs/display... (commit 820739), and then from this commit, a branch is created to
fix an undecorated frame resizing issue (commit 004e3e), then another branch that eventually has a
change in test/lisp/tramp-tests.el (commit 49cd561). This final branch is merged into the master
branch (commit abcb2e), and then after a couple more changes are made on the branch that had
commit 49cd561, it is again merged into the master branch (commit 98ac35e). Essentially, what is
happening is emacs was incremented to version 27, and then changes/updates are being made on the
emacs 26 release branch before being merged with the main branch (representing emacs version 27).
