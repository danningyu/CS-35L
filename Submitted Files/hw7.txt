Throughout this lab, I used lnxsrv05.

1. I used the command emacs hw7.txt.

2. To get a new branch called quote with v3.0 of Diffutils, I used:
cd diffutils
git checkout v3.0 -b quote

This gave the following output:
       src/cmp.c
       src/diff.c
       src/diff3.c
       src/dir.c
       src/sdiff.c
       src/util.c
Switched to a new branch 'quote'

3. To apply the patch, I used:
patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

4. The emacs command C-x 4 a (add-change-log-entry-other-window) allows for
a new entry to be added to the change log of the file that is currently
being edited.

5. I opened the patch using emacs quote-3.0-patch.txt, and then wrote the
following entry:

2019-11-16  Danning Liu Yu  <danning@lnxsrv05.seas.ucla.edu>

        * quote-3.0-patch.txt: This patch is in response to a recent change in
        GNU coding standards, which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like
        this", instead of `like this' or ``like this''. This change only
        applies to character string constants in .c src files.

        Following files were changed:
        src/cmp.c
        src/diff.c
        src/diff3.c
        src/dir.c
        src/sdiff.c
        src/util.c

I then saved the file (C-x C-s) and exited (C-x C-c).

6. I moved the patch out of the diffutils folder and then commited using the
following commands:
mv quote-3.0-patch.txt ../quote-3.0-patch.txt
git add .
git commit -F ChangeLog

7. I used the following command to generated a formatted patch:
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

I checked the formatted patch file and looks very similar to the file 
quote-3.0-patch.txt, as expected.

8. Partner: Janis Chen, UID: 105096822

I made a new folder, cloned the respository into the folder, and then switched
it to the v3.0 commit on a new branch called partner:
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git
cd diffutils
git checkout tags/v3.0
git checkout v3.0 -b partner
git am formatted-patch-JC.txt
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

It passed some test cases, but the ones that it failed were the same as ones
that failed in the version of Diffutils that I used to generate this patch.
I manually opened some of the .c files and verified that the ` characters in
constant string literals had been changed to '.

9. I verified the changelog entry was there by running the following commands:
make distdir

This created a new directory called diffutils-3.0.1-6dd9, and within that
contains the ChangeLog with my partner's commit message.

cd diffutils-3.0.1-6dd9
emacs ChangeLog

Indeed, the commit message from my partner's patch was there.

10. I fist installed Xming onto my computer, and then enabled X11 forwarding
in PuTTY. Then, I ran the following commands:
cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
gitk

This caused a new window to open, containing a GUI representation of the git
commit history for the emacs repository. The newest merge not newer than
2015-01-25 is merging the 'master' branch into xwidget. The top left window
shows the two branches and then getting merged together, hte window next to it
shows the author of the operation, and the window to the rigt of that shows
the date this operation occurred. In the bottom left window, it contains the
commit/merge message, and the to the right of that window is a window for
comments. The SHA1 of the merge is also displayed, as well as  a simple GUI
for finding specific commits.
