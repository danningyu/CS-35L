1. The performance of ls improved: Prepend the "time" command to ls, and one
gets the following run times for running ls on /usr/bin:
time ./cuinstall/bin/ls /usr/bin outputs a real time of 0.060 s
time ./coreutils-8.29/src/ls /usr/bin outputs a real time of 0.056 s

Examining the patch file, we see that the patch removes a case 'A': statement,
which speeds up the program. Also, in general a bug has been fixed, which
also increases the performance of the program (in a correctness sense).


2. If in a program or script, you use the -a -A bug of the previous version of
ls on purpose to override the -A command so that . and .. are always listed, 
there may be issues that arise from the upgrade. Or, if you have a program
that uses -A and -a in combination interchangeably, the program's behavior
will change because -a and -A are no longer be interchangeable.

3. It throws an IndexError: list index out of range. This occurs because
len(seq) = 0, so it tries to return seq[0], which is out of bounds because
seq is empty. 

4. It throws a SyntaxError: invalid syntax, on line 65 of the file. This is
because in Python 3, error handling syntax is except IOError as err:

5. I ran my script with multiple test cases using Python 2 instead of 3 and
there did not appear to be any visible differences.
