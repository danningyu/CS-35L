Lab:
Checked locale - not C locale, so used export LC_ALL='C' to change it.
Verified that it changed by using locale again afterwards.

Then used sort /usr/share/dict/words > ~/words

To extract HTML page:
wget [CS35L assignment 2 link], where link was:
https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall19/cs35L/assign/assign2.html

tr commands: used cat assign2.html | [tr command] > output.txt
1) tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]': 
Deletes all lines that don't contain A-Z or a-z.
Replaces them with a newline.

2)tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]':
Adding -s option consolidates consecutive repeated newlines into one newline.
This makes the output more readable.

3) tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort: 
This sorts the lines of what tr produces. 
Capital letters come before lowercase letters and the sorting is alphabetical.

4) tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u:
Aadding the -u options eliminates any duplicate words.

5) tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words: 
Compare output of command #4  to words. Column 1 for words unique to tr output.
Column 2 is for words unique to words, column 3 is for words in both files.

6) tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words:
This command outputs only words unique to the output of the 4th tr command.
The -23 flag eliminates the 2nd and 3rd columns.

To make hwords:
1) Get HTML file
wget https://www.mauimapp.com/moolelo/hwnwdshw.htm  # get HTML file
mv hwndshw.htm hwordsUnfinished  # change file name
vim buildwords

2) Create script
grep '.*</td>' | \ #isolate lines with td tags only
sed 's/<[^>]*>//g' | \ #get rid of all HTML comments
tr "\`" "\'" | \ #replace ` with '
tr "A-Z" "a-z" | \ #all uppercase to lowercase
sed 's/^ *//g' | \ #delete leading whitespace in lines
sed 's/?//g' | \ #delete all ? characters
grep -E "^[pk'mnwlhaeiou ]+$" | \ #delete all lines with non-hawaiian chars
sed 's/ /\n/g' | \ #replace all spaces with newlines
grep -E -v '^$' | \ #delete all blank lines
sort -u #sort and eliminate any duplicates

3) modify permissions and run script
chmod u+x buildwords
cat hwordsUnfinished | ./buildwords > hwords

ENGLISHCHECKER:
cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | \
sort -u | comm -23 - words

Then pipe to wc -w to get # of words, or to badEng.txt to save as text file.

HAWAIIANCHECKER:
sed 's/<[^>]*>//g' | tr "\`" "\'" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | \
tr -cs "A-Aa-z'" '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - hwords

Then pipe to wc -w to get # of words, or to badHI.txt to save as text file.

Distinct misspelled words of assignment page using ENGLISHCHECKER: 37 words.
(Note: converted all letters in assignment page to lowercase).

Distinct misspelled words using HAWAIIANCHECKER: 515 words
