Setting up the BeagleBone:
To setup the BeagleBone, I carried out the following steps, following the
instructions outlined on Piazza:

1. Connected BeagleBone to my computer using the provided uSB cable. Opened it
as an external storage device. Opened the START.htm file and installed the
appropriate drivers.

2. ssh'd into the device using PuTTY, with the host being 192.168.7.2, on port
22. Logged in as the root user.

3. Connected to the wifi:
connmanctl
enable wifi
scan wifi
services (this lists all the wifi access points found during the scan)
agent on
connect [string next to wifi name]
quit

4. Install updated packages:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xauth
sudo apt-get install xvfb
sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb 

5. Test X11 forwarding: I typed "firefox" into the terminal and indeed, an
XMing window popped up with firefox on it. However, there were a large number
of errors that popped up, of this form:
(/usr/lib/firefox-esr/firefox-esr:1613): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: 
g_object_unref: assertion 'object->ref_count > 0' failed

However, these errors did not seem to really affect the functionality of
Firefox.

I was able to complete all of these steps, thus setting up my BeagleBone.

--------------------
Setting up the server:

To generate a public-private key pair:
ssh-keygen

When prompted for the directory, I pressed enter to save the key to the
default directory (/root.ssh/id_rsa). Then, I used "123456" for the passphrase.
The following output resulted:

Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
4a:44:f0:d5:3f:ab:50:1c:ce:ad:bd:e6:16:b8:23:2e root@beaglebone
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|    ... ..       |
|     o .  o      |
|      o  + +     |
|     .    = +    |
|      . S. + o   |
|     . .. o +    |
|      .  . o o   |
|      E . + +    |
|       o.. =.    |
+-----------------+

I then created a new user with username "user1" and password "abcdef":
cd /home
sudo useradd -d /home/user1 -m user1
sudo passwd user1
Enter new UNIX password: abcdef
Retype new UNIX password: abcdef
passwd: password updated successfully

I then created a .ssh directory and let user1 be its owner and changed the
directory's permissions:
cd /home/user1
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R user1 .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Finally, I got the IP address of the BeagleBone so that I could give it to
anyone that wanted to connect as a client:
hostname -I

------------------------------
Setting up the client:

Generate key:
ssh-keygen

It asked if I wanted to override the previously generated key. I typed "y
for yes.

ssh-copy-id -i joshualiu97@192.168.137.211

It then asked me if I trusted the server, as I had never logged in before.
I responded with "yes", and then I typed in the password for the joshualiu97
account, which my partner created.

Then, I started ssh-agent:
eval $(ssh-agent)

It outputted the following line:
Agent pid 2664

Then I added my private key to the authentication agent:
ssh-add

Then it said the key was added, as expected.

Then I logged in again:
ssh joshualiu97@192.168.137.211

It did not ask me for a password this time because ssh-agent saved it already.
I then created a file:
vim testfile.txt

My partner was able to see the file on his terminal.

To test X11 forwarding, I used:
ssh -X joshualiu97@192.168.137.211

Then I tried to open Firefox:
firefox

An XMing window with Firefox popped up, as expected.
