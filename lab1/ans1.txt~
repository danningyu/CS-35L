Lab:

1. man -k
2. /usr/local/cs/bin/mv
   /usr/local/cs/bin/cp
   commands used:
   which mv
   which cp
3. ar: allows for creation and manipulation of archives, as well as extracting from them.
   tr: used to translating or deleting letters, such as from lowercase to uppercase.
   pr: formats files by adding pages and columns to make it look better when printed
   find /usr/bin -name "?"r
4. /usr/bin/emacs-24.3
   commands used:
   readlink -f /usr/bin/emacs
5. /usr/bin/gcc: 4.8.5
   gcc: 9.2.0
   commands used:
   gcc --version
   /usr/bin/gcc --version
   Different because gcc is actually in /usr/local/cs/bin, so it is distinct from /usr/bin/gcc.

6. chmod u+sx,o-w: u+sx part means to set the user ID for the user (temporarily giving it same permissions as superuser), which will allow execute permissions to be added. The o-w part means to remove write permissions from other users.
   Commands used:
   man chmod
7. find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28
FIRST 5 plus # of directories

   commands used:
   which find
   cd /usr/bin
   man grep
   man wc
   ls -la | grep "\->" | wc -l
   Note: done on lnxsrv09
9. librom1394.so.0.3.0
   commands used:
   ls /usr/lib64 -lta
10. It gets its data from /usr/lib/locale. Found using man 7 locale.
use man -k locale and find the right locale file
11. downcase-dwim
    downcase-region
    downcase-word
    emacs commands used:
    emacs
    C-h a downcase
12. C-M-r does a backwards regexp incremental search
    C-M-s does a forwards incremental regexp search
    C-M-t transposes two expressions, which means it moves one expression ahead of another
    C-M-u moves up one level of parentheses
    C-M-v scrolls the next window down in emacs if one exists
    emacs commands used:
    C-h k C-m-r
    C-h k C-m-s
    C-h k C-m-t
    C-h k C-m-u
    C-h k C-m-v
13. C-g quits (clears) out any current commands and stops any commands that are currently running. It rusn the command keyboard-quit.
    emacs commands used:
    C-h k C-g   
14. The yank function pastes the first entry from the kill-ring. It essentially acts as "paste" in "cut/copy" and then "paste." It is executed using C-y.
    emacs commands used: 
    C-h a yank
15. ls -l lists total storageused, while dired in emacs lists total storageused and available storage. Dired also allows users to edit the directory while ls only lists it.
    shell commands used for ls -l:
    ls -l > output.txt
    emacs output.txt

    emacs commands used for dired:
    M-x dired [delete any current directory text] /usr/bin M-<



use man -k locale and find the right locale file
3. Using find /usr/bin -name "?"r, where the find command finds files, in the specified directory /usr/bin, and then filter those files by name to contain any character (the "?") and then r. How each command works was then found using man [command].
   (1)(maybe??)  ar is used to either create, modify, or extract from an archive file.
   (2) tr is used to delete/replace characters. Filters are also available for deleting whitespace, digits only, alphabetic letters only, lowercase letters only, etc.
   (3) pr takes in a text file and prepares it for printing by paginating it and modifying the columns as needed.

4. First, cd to /usr/bin. Then, use ls -l | grep emacs to find all files related to emacs, and then we can see that what is actually executed is /etc/alternatives/emacs

5. gcc has a version of 4.9.2, while /usr/bin/gcc has a version of 4.4.7. This is beacuse gcc (standalone) is in /usr/local/cs/bin, so it is actually a different file from the gcc in /usr/bin/gcc. I used gcc --version and /usr/bin/gcc --version to get the version numbers.

6. The command u+sx,o-w means to set the user ID and add executable permissions for the user, and then remove write permissions from the other group of users.

7. I used the command find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28 to find all directories (-type d) modified in the last 28 days (-atime -28).

8. There are 20 symbolic links. I used ls -la | grep "\->" | wc, where ls -la is used to list all files, and then grep "/->" is used to filter out only files with name containing "/->", which denotes a symbolic link, and then wc counts the number lines/words/characters.

9. ls /usr/lib64 -lt | tail -n 1

10. It gets its data from /usr/lib/locale, found man 7 locale

11. C-h a downcase, downcase-dwim, downcase-region, downcase-word

12. , , , , 

13. The C-g command clears out any partially typed command (essentially cancelling it). It also stops any commands that are currently running.


15. The ls -l command lists all files and colors exectuables green and symbolic links green/blue, while dired in emacs only colors symbolic links blue. The output is the same content-wise. dired in emacs is executed using C-x d, and then typing in the directory.
